Track High-Value Cards: The computer can keep track of high-value cards played by the player throughout the game. If the player has already played many high-value cards, the computer can adjust its bidding strategy accordingly, knowing that the player is less likely to have another high-value card.
Observe Patterns: The computer can look for patterns in the player's bidding behavior. For example, if the player consistently bids aggressively or conservatively in certain situations, the computer can use this information to predict the player's next move.
Bluffing: Just like in poker, the computer can incorporate bluffing into its bidding strategy. By occasionally bidding higher or lower than expected, the computer can keep the player guessing and potentially gain an advantage.

Risk Assessment: The computer can assess the risk associated with each bidding decision by considering factors such as the value of the diamond card, the likelihood of the player having a higher-value card, and the potential payoff of winning the round. By weighing these factors, the computer can make more calculated bidding choices.

Probability of Card Distribution: The computer can calculate the probability of certain cards being in play based on the cards that have already been played. For example, if several high-value cards have already been played, the probability of the player having another high-value card decreases, and the computer can adjust its bidding strategy accordingly.
Adaptability: The computer can be programmed to adapt its bidding strategy based on the outcome of previous rounds. For example, if the player consistently wins with high-value cards, the computer may become more conservative in its bidding to avoid losing by bidding too low.
